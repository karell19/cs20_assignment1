        <h2>Assignment 1: Get on the Web!</h2>
        <p>My name is Kevin Arellano Flores</p>
        <p>My major is: Computer Science</p>
        <p>My IP Address is: 130.64.64.68</p>
        <p>I grew up in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
        <p>I think many people wouldn't expect about me: I know how to play both the piano and violin.</p>
        <p>All my most favorite places are by the ocean. This is a picture under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fransisco, CA.</p>
